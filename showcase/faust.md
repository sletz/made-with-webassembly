[Faust](https://faust.grame.fr) (Functional Audio Stream) is a functional programming language for sound synthesis and audio processing with a strong focus on the design of synthesizers, musical instruments, audio effects, etc. Faust targets high-performance signal processing applications and audio plug-ins for a variety of platforms and standards.

The online [Faust IDE](https://faustide.grame.fr) can be used to _edit_, _compile_ and _run_ Faust code from any recent Web Browser with webassembly support. It works completely on the client side and it is therefore very convenient for situations with many simultaneous users (workshops, classrooms, etc.). It embeds the latest version of the Faust compiler with an efficient webassembly backend and offers polyphonic MIDI support.
